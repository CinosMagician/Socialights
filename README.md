## Installation Instructions

This is just an API framework, as such, there is no webpage attached to this. To use, run the command 
```
npm run seed; npm run start;
```
This will seed the database with users first to play around with, then start the server. You will need to use a program like mongooseDB or Insomnia to interact with the api calls to get a good look at what is going on. As seen in the demo Video, Insomnia is the program used to achieve this.
    
## Usage Info

As the Demo Video states, using Insomnia we are able to explore and interact with the different API calls.
